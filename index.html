                    <p>My name is Taylor Doodchenko. I have a marketing diploma from George Brown College and have worked for two years in a digital marketing role, developing digital marketing strategy and doing web content management for a large Ontario financial Institution. In highschool I took a introductory computer programming class but I didn't really become interested in coding until being tasked with building a website for a subsidiary, life insurance company. Although I only acted as a liaison between the developers and the costumer, during construction I was exposed to some of the underlying code while managing the content of the site. I am more than excited to be taking on this new journey towards becoming a full stack developer.

                    <p>A little more about me: I am a huge follower of baseball and hockey, and love to play when I have the time. Music is another passion of mine; I play guitar and love to write music when time permits. My music interests ranges from classical to heavy metal so don't even ask... </p>
